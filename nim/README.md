# nim-game
Implementing the game of Nim vs a simple computer AI in Java for CSC 421. This implementation of Nim has 13 coins in a single pile. Each turn, the player (or AI) takes 1, 2, or 3 coins from the pile. The player that makes the move that takes the last coins from the pile loses.

Code for my implementation of Nim is based on code implementing Tic Tac Toe that was provided for the course. This code can be found in the original_code folder.

The majority of the code that I wrote can be found in GameNim.java and StateNim.java. Game.java, State.java, and Search.java were largely reused from the original code.
